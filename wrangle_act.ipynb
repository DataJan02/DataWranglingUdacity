However, a value of \"a\" or \"an\" or words instead of nouns, is invalid and happens when text parsing is based on few sentence constructs. This can be solved by converting such words to 'None'.\n",
    "3. Accuracy - For those that have ratings and have a denominator other than 10, pick the rating with denominator of 10 if it exists\n",
    "5. Completeness - Maintain a column to maintain the list of domains associated with the tweet.\n",
    "6. Validity - For records in which there hasn't been a dog prediction, with at least 0.1 accuracy, mark as inconclusive.\n",
    "7. Consistency - Only retain records that talk about a single dog, so that the analytics and visualizations can revolve around that accordingly.\n",
    "8. Consistency - For the sake of predictions, maintain only the records that have images associated. (Already achieved by performing inner join between data sources.)\n",

    "##### DEFINE - Accuracy - For the Name column, some of the rows have None, as the name might not be mentioned in the tweet. It is a valid scenario. However, a value of \"a\" or \"an\" or words instead of nouns, is invalid and happens when text parsing is based on few sentence constructs. This can be solved by extracting the names/nouns from text and correcting those rows. From the list above, it's clear that the names that start with a lowercase letter are the culprits. Let's first turn them to 'None'"
